# Mesh-Extruder-Blender-Unity-
It is just a grid based line drawer on ground plane in blender and a raw one for Unity, currently, potential roadmap is to make a full fledged free low-poly make it quick solution.
In the end you get a quickly extruded N-Gon (will add a toggle auto a triangulate and tris to quad later).

Still better than to do it from scratch with hotkeys? Let me know.
