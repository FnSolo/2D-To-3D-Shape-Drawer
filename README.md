# Mesh-Extruder-Blender-Unity-
It is just a grid based line drawer on ground plane in Blender and a raw one for Unity, currently, potential roadmap is to make a full fledged free low-poly make it quick solution.
In the end you get a quickly extruded N-Gon (will add a toggle auto a triangulate and tris to quad later).

Is it better than to do defaultly it from scratch with hotkeys? Let me know.

Blender version features:
1. Grid based dot placing on ground plane that automatically turn to edges
2. Merged in the end with LMB near last point or just by pressing RMB if there is at least 2 dots already
3. Placing dots while not looking topdown or downtop is not recommended.
4. Etc?

The May Be Roadmap:
1. Make it a full fledge make a low-poly asset for games thing
2. Color in one click, texture draw whole separated meshes.
3. Separate meshes more easily than default solution
4. Make a solid mesh back easily
5. Proper Auto-UV unwrapping in the process
6. All features are toggleable up to the state of classic simplest version


Extra:

7. You are dead after fixing AI bugs and fixing Python identations, because your VSC flickers, as is it does the Upscayl when you upscaled your image.
